                    <p><b>E</b>ver felt like life hit pause on your dreams? I'm talking about you reading this. Meet Matthew, a steadfast believer who faced endless setbacks in his quest for a job. Despite graduating with flying colors, he found himself stuck in a rut for over 3 years, contemplating settling for a meager teaching gig. But amidst his darkest hour, Matthew clung to a promise: "He never sleeps; he never slumbers" (Psalm 121:3). His story is a testament to the unwavering truth that delay is not denial—it's simply a pit stop on the road to greatness.

                    </p>
                      <p>On this faithful day, Matthew got a call from an international organization where he once applied for a lucrative role 2 years ago. It was about a negotiation and quick resumption with an upfront salary payment in advance of 2 years. They apologized for the break in communication because he was actually approved for resumption 2 years earlier and didn't know how his appointment offer got lost in the recruitment process. God promises to turn our dreams into reality (Psalm 126:1-2) When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream. Matthew, who found a breakthrough through the storms of life, has become a testament for any young believer that faces the same storm of delay. Here is the verdict from God, "You cannot be Denied."</p>

                  Redefining Breakfast: Waiting for Love's Sunrise</h4>
                  <p>
                    In matters of the heart, the wait for true love can feel like an endless series of breakfasts—each serving disappointment. But as Psalm 30:5 reminds us, joy inevitably follows sorrow. So, while you wait, nurture your spirit, fortify your self-worth, and craft a life that sings with purpose. Dive into your passions, conquer your goals, and above all, trust in the divine plan unfolding before you.
