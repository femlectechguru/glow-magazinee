                    <p><b>S</b>o you know those perfect couples that we would usually meet at work, school or even church events, they just seem to have figured out life. I mean everytime warm cozy outfits with matching pairs, Pixel art wedding photoshoots and even the glamour date nights or picnics from newly Weds that they would use to pepper single people into deep imagination and wonder. Yet in everything some of them still ended with a nicely served Breakfast. You must have sat down and Wondered asking yourself what it would take for both lovers to fix their problems or am I the only one left in wonderland? Before you pass me off as a pessimist please Hear me out!

                      My Friend told me about this sister called Alice around 2 years ago, a wonderful sister and a supposed daughter of Abraham, now I'm not so sure anymore. Her father was the most Senior Pastor of the church and we basically had everything planned out, it was supposed to catch the News headlines. How do I even share my story without opening up deep wounds, he said to me as he spoke softly with a sorrowful expression. I can still remember vividly how it all happened, how that on the most important day of our lives she left me at the Alter. 
                      That decision changed my life and ever since then, I have been searching for My Authentic self he said anxiously. Gently holding my hands he asked, Who have I become? can I still fix myself?. Everyone now tells me that I no longer have that vibrant vigor I once had, charming smile and friendly attitude. I can't believe I lost all that, wherever you are Alice, you didn't just leave me, you took a part of me with you he spoke trying to hide those tears, but it was too late. To make matters worse she is now married and leaving the country next week to our dream vacation with her new Man. The air in my office was palpable. After much silence he finally concluded, I still have nightmares of that event, I guess I was the only one stuck in wonderland.
                      So you can Imagine the next time I hear the phrase "Men are Scum". I mean just give me a break because I genuinely cannot relate, how now? please tell me who's the actual Scum here?
                      Just like my beloved brother, I too have begun to wonder why sometimes we invest so much into someone special who we believe is right for us, and even after doing all our due diligence and careful considerations including being led by God, it can still fail. Why do others have it easy and some don't? All these questions pondered in my heart until I shared 3 things from the Holy spirit.

                    EMBRACING GOD'S TIMING</h4>
                  <p>God is the only one in heaven and on earth who has the ability to love us with an everlasting love (Jerem 31:3). Just because you have started sharing butterfly feelings with your partner, doesn't guarantee that you would have a happy ever after. After all, every divorced couple we have today once believed that they couldn't live without each other.

                    RETROSPECTIVE</h4>
                  <p>As a Believer, no matter how much in love you may seem to be, you cannot draw your meaning, purpose and fulfilment from your spouse. Infact Christ and the Church should be our pattern and best example. Ephesians 5:24-25 
                    "Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing. [25] Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it"; Because in our world today, there is an aspect of love we may have left behind, this has nothing to do feelings, it is called commitment. Having commitment to each other becomes easy when look at the pattern and example set by Christ.

                <h4 data-aos="fade-down">GOD IS LOVE </h4>
                  <p>God can heal a broken heart He just needs to have all the pieces. Some of us are carrying the burden of a broken heart and have become busy trying to fix ourselves. Just like in the case of my beloved brother who lost himself in wonderland. In truth we are all humans with feelings, and when we give so much without ever receiving back, it could break us. I wish we can all practice the Gospel hymn written by our pastor composer "Elisha Hoffman" - I must tell Jesus, I must tell Jesus, I cannot bear this burden alone. I must tell Jesus, I must tell Jesus, Jesus can help, Jesus Alone. One thing we can always be sure about is that Christ has a track record of healing broken hearts and yours would not be an exception. 

                    As I shared these words, I watched him brake down in tears, I never saw him weep that way. God has now healed him and now he has found peace with himself.

                <h4 data-aos="fade-down">HOPE IS NOT LOST: </h4>
                  <p> Dear friend, Please know that no matter your past and how hurt you may have been, maybe someone took your Joy and happiness, know that your history is also a part of His-Story, God can make your scars a point of contact for healing to the world and many who would share your pain, so don't ever run from God again, instead run to Him, run as a child going to report to her her Father with the words in your mouth, "I must tell Jesus".

                <h4 data-aos="fade-down">BALANCING LIFE AND EMOTIONAL TURMOIL  </h4>
                  <p>In life, we may often encounter moments that leave us questioning our realities. This sentiment arises from disappointments, heartbreaks, and the inevitable clashes with those who may not align with our expectations. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that reducing individuals to labels oversimplifies the complexity of human nature. People are all different, influenced by where they come from, what they've been through, and the situations they've faced. Instead of putting everyone in the same group with negative generalizations, let us try to understand the underlying factors that contribute to our perceptions.

                    Life's journey introduces us to an array of personalities, each with their own problems and good qualities. Understanding that these actions are not always a reflection of the entire character in a group helps us to be more understanding and open-minded in our interactions. While it's natural to encounter challenges and encounter individuals who may not meet our standards, it's equally important to resist the temptation to generalize. Accepting that people are different brings personal growth and creates a place where kindness and understanding can thrive.
